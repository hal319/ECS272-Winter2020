        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The visualization shows the diversity in tech industry in several aspects breakdown by each of the top tech companies. The diversity is represented by the percentages of several representative categories of people. 
            The visualization is interactive. You can click on each of the categories at the top of the chart to rank/sort the data. (e.g. the company names will be sorted in alphabetic order, and the percentages will be ranked 
        in increasing or decreasing order. There is also an option to show year to year changes in the data. It uses contracting colors (deep purple and light green) to represent female and male. Horizontally stacked bar chart is used to directly show 
    the comparison between the percentages for the two genders. I think it is a good visualization. The color choices and the ranking feature are designed to show a trend in the data and to
observe the numbers for the majority of the companies. The vivid presentation of the data and the implied trend will be useful for the related studies. The year to year change feature is helpful in the way that it can clearly visualize how the data has evolved over the years. 
The interactive nature of the visualization will also get more attention and 
make the data more widely spread, thus making a greater impact.</p>
